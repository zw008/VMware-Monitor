"""MCP server wrapping VMware Monitor read-only operations.

This module exposes **read-only** VMware vCenter/ESXi monitoring tools via
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using stdio transport.  Each ``@mcp.tool()``
function delegates to the corresponding function in the ``vmware_monitor``
package (ops.inventory, ops.health, ops.vm_info).

**NO destructive operations exist in this module or anywhere in the
vmware-monitor codebase**: no power_on, power_off, create, delete,
reconfigure, snapshot-create/revert/delete, clone, or migrate.

Security considerations
-----------------------
* **All tools are read-only**: Every tool only queries vSphere state;
  none can modify VMs, hosts, or configuration.
* **Credential handling**: Credentials are loaded from environment
  variables / ``.env`` file — never passed via MCP messages.
* **Transport**: Uses stdio transport (local only); no network listener.

    """Return an agent-safe error string; log full detail server-side only.

    Raw exception text can carry API response bodies, internal paths, or
    host:port pairs. Full traceback goes to the server log; the agent sees only
    a control-char-stripped, length-capped message.

    Every exception this skill raises on purpose passes through: the builtin
    validation errors, and the domain exceptions defined under
    ``vmware_monitor.ops``. Those three cover this skill's most common failure —
    a name that does not resolve — and each carries the sentence naming the
    listing tool that produces a valid one. Omitting them replaced that sentence
    with ``VMNotFoundError: operation failed.`` on the way to the agent, so the
    teaching text was written, printed in full by the CLI, and discarded at the
    one surface where a model would have used it.

    ``TimeoutError`` and ``ConnectionError`` are here for the same reason: the
    CLI path catches ``OSError`` and prints a retry hint, and the two surfaces
    should not disagree about what a dropped connection means.

    The configuration errors this skill raises on purpose — the missing-password
    error, this family's most common first-run failure, and the connection
    layer's authored replacement for a transport failure — pass through as the
    narrow ``ConfigError``. Bare ``OSError`` was briefly listed here for them and
    was too wide a door: ``sanitize`` strips control characters and truncates, it
    does not redact, so ``ssl.SSLCertVerificationError`` (certificate subject and
    hostname), ``socket.gaierror`` (the name that failed to resolve) and
    ``requests``-style connection errors (full scheme://host:port/path) all
    reached the agent verbatim through it. Only the narrow ``OSError`` subclasses
    that were allowed before it remain.

    Anything else is reduced to its type — an unplanned exception's text was
    written for a developer reading a traceback, not for an agent choosing what
    to do next, and it is the one that can carry credentials.
