"""Inventory-wide snapshot aging and sprawl analysis (read-only).

`ops.vm_info.list_snapshots` lists snapshots for *one* VM but does no
judgement. This module sweeps the whole inventory to surface the operational
risk that snapshots create: forgotten old snapshots that silently consume
datastore space and slow down I/O.

Read-only — it never creates, reverts, or deletes a snapshot. Remediation is
routed to vmware-aiops (which owns snapshot delete/consolidate).
