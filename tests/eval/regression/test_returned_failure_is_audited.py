"""A tool that catches its exception must still be audited as a failure.

``@vmware_tool`` records a call as failed when an exception reaches it, or when
the returned payload is a dict carrying a truthy ``error`` key. A tool that
catches the exception and returns an error **string** instead looks exactly like
a success, and three things follow: the audit row says ``status=ok`` for an
operation that failed, an undo token is written for a change that never landed,
and the circuit breaker is told ``success=True`` so repeated failures never trip
it.

This skill does not have that defect, and this file is what keeps that true
rather than merely observed. ``_catch_tool_errors`` returns
``{"error": ..., "hint": ...}``, which is the family's documented envelope and is
detected by vmware-policy itself — so no explicit ``report_tool_failure`` call is
needed here, and adding one would be redundant with the detection that already
covers it.

Both halves of that reasoning are load-bearing and both are asserted:

* the *shape* — every registered tool is annotated to return a ``dict``. A tool
  added later that returns a plain string would be detected by nothing, and this
  is where that shows up;
* the *behaviour* — a failing tool, driven through the real ``@vmware_tool``
  wrapper, produces an audit row whose status is ``error``. Reading the
  decorator stack is not the same as watching what it records.
