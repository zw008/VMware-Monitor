"""A teaching message the agent never sees is not a teaching message.

``_safe_error`` reduces unrecognised exceptions to ``"<Class>: operation
failed."`` so raw vSphere text cannot leak. Its allowlist held only the builtin
validation errors, so all three exceptions this skill defines for its own domain
— ``VMNotFoundError``, ``HostNotFoundError``, ``DatastoreNotFoundError`` — had
their messages replaced by their class names on the way to the agent.

Those three cover the most common failure this skill has: a name that does not
resolve. They exist precisely to say which listing tool produces a valid name,
and that sentence was being thrown away at the last step. The CLI printed it in
full and the error-quality eval read it at the raise site, so nothing measured
what actually arrived.

The same defect existed one layer earlier for the missing-password error — this
family's most common *first-run* failure, whose whole remedy is the ``.env`` path
and env var name it carries. An agent hitting an unconfigured target received
``OSError: operation failed.`` and had nothing to act on.

Admitting bare ``OSError`` fixed that and opened a wider door than intended.
``sanitize`` strips control characters and truncates; it does not redact. So
``socket.gaierror`` (the name that failed to resolve) and connection errors
carrying a full ``scheme://host:port/path`` reached the agent verbatim through
that entry. The narrow :class:`~vmware_monitor.config.ConfigError` carries the
messages that needed to pass, and nothing else.

Narrowing alone is not sufficient, and this is the part an allowlist cannot
express. ``ssl.SSLCertVerificationError`` subclasses **both** ``OSError`` and
``ValueError``, and ``ValueError`` has been on this list since long before
``OSError`` was — so the certificate subject went on arriving however narrow the
``OSError`` side became. A list of types that may pass has no way to say "except
this one"; the reduction has to run *ahead* of it.

What replaces the raw text is the connection layer's authored
:class:`~vmware_monitor.connection.ConnectError`, which names the target as
config.yaml spells it and its ``verify_ssl`` setting — never the resolved host,
the port, or the certificate.
