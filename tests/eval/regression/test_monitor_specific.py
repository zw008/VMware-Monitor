"""Regression tests — pyVmomi API misuse found in the 2026-06 vim-conformance audit.

Shared-code bugs with VMware-AIops (family rule: fix in both repos together):

- H: sensor status comes from healthState.key (green/yellow/red), not sensorType
- M: event class is DVPortgroupReconfiguredEvent (lowercase g) — typo'd names never match

See tests/eval/regression/test_vim_attribute_conformance.py for the generic
introspection net that prevents the whole bug class.
