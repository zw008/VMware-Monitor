  Use this skill for safe, risk-free queries of VMware infrastructure — code-level enforced safety means no destructive operations exist in the codebase.
  Directly handles: a one-glance cross-cluster health summary, object-centered VM/host/datastore investigation drill-downs (correlating surrounding infrastructure + recent events), a cross-vCenter "what needs attention now?" rollup, list VMs/hosts/datastores/clusters, active alarms, recent events, VM details.
  Always use vmware-monitor when the user asks to "list VMs", "check vSphere alarms", "show host status", "is anything on fire", "what needs attention now", "what is happening around this VM/host/datastore", "investigate this VM" — or needs read-only VMware info before making changes.
  Do NOT use for any write operations — this skill is code-level read-only and cannot modify, create, or delete any resource.
  For VM modifications use vmware-aiops, for networking use vmware-nsx, for metrics/capacity use vmware-aria. For load balancing/AVI/AKO use vmware-avi.

  vmware-policy auto-installed as Python dependency (provides @vmware_tool decorator and audit logging). All operations audited to ~/.vmware/audit.db.
  Credentials: Each vCenter/ESXi target requires a per-target password env var in ~/.vmware-monitor/.env following the pattern VMWARE_<TARGET_NAME_UPPER>_PASSWORD (e.g., target "vcenter-prod" → VMWARE_VCENTER_PROD_PASSWORD). SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL and DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL are optional — disabled by default, user-configured only, used solely by the opt-in daemon scanner. Daemon: the background scanner (vmware-monitor daemon start) is user-initiated only, never auto-started. Webhook payloads contain only aggregated alert metadata (alarm counts, event types) — no credentials, IPs, or PII.

## What This Skill Does

All 27 tools are **read-only**.

| Category | Capabilities |
|----------|-------------|
| **Cluster Triage** | One-glance `cluster_health_summary` — cross-cluster Problems/Capacity/Health rollup with an opinionated status; customizable view |
| **Object Investigation** | "What is happening around this VM / host / datastore?" — one correlated drill-down bundle per object, plus `cross_vcenter_attention` — one ranked "what needs attention now?" list across every configured vCenter |
| **Inventory** | List VMs, ESXi hosts, datastores, clusters, networks |
| **Health** | Active alarms, recent events (filter by severity/time), hardware sensors, host services |
| **Performance** | Real-time host & VM CPU/memory/disk/network utilisation (PerfManager) |
| **Capacity** | Datastore thin-provisioning over-commit, resource-pool reservation/usage |
| **Infra Health** | ESXi certificate expiry, license usage/expiry, NTP configuration health |
| **Snapshots** | Inventory-wide snapshot aging & sprawl (flag old snapshots) |
| **Activity** | In-flight tasks, active login sessions |
| **VM Details** | CPU, memory, disks, NICs, snapshots, guest OS, IP |
| **Scanning** | Scheduled alarm/log scanning with Slack/Discord webhooks |

## Quick Install

```bash
uv tool install vmware-monitor
vmware-monitor doctor
```

## When to Use This Skill

- List or search VMs, hosts, datastores, clusters
- Check active alarms or recent events
- Get detailed info about a specific VM
- Set up scheduled monitoring with webhook alerts
- Any read-only VMware query where safety is paramount

### Alarm/Event Output: `suggested_actions` Field

`get_alarms` and `get_events` results include a `suggested_actions` list. Each
item is a ready-to-use hint naming the correct companion skill and tool call
(e.g. `"vmware-aiops: acknowledge_vcenter_alarm(entity_name=..., alarm_name=...)"`),
so agents — especially smaller local models — can follow them directly without
reasoning about skill routing. Example payload: `references/capabilities.md`.

**Use companion skills for**:
- Power on/off, deploy, clone, migrate --> `vmware-aiops`
- iSCSI, vSAN, datastore management --> `vmware-storage`
- Tanzu Kubernetes clusters --> `vmware-vks`
- Load balancing, AVI/ALB, AKO, Ingress --> `vmware-avi`

## Common Workflows

> **Diagnostic investigations**: Before running any "why is X failing / down / abnormal" workflow, follow [`references/investigation-protocol.md`](references/investigation-protocol.md). It enforces the four root-cause completeness criteria (falsifiability / sufficiency / necessity / mechanism) and the up-to-three-rounds deepening loop. Since vmware-monitor is read-only, it serves as the data source — actuation belongs to companion skills like vmware-aiops.

### Cluster Health Check ("is anything on fire?" / "what's wrong right now?")

**Judgment**: this is the 5-second triage glance, not an Aria replacement. One call rolls every cluster's hosts, VM power, live CPU/memory and alarms up, flattens the individual anomalies into a ranked **top-N focus list** (`top_issues`), and gives each cluster an opinionated `status`. On a big fleet, lead with the focus list — scanning per-cluster rows is too slow.

1. One glance --> `vmware-monitor summary` (MCP: `cluster_health_summary`). Read `top_issues` first (worst first, each with a drill-down `next step`); the per-cluster table is context. `issues_total` shows how many anomalies existed before the top-N cap
2. Tighten or widen the focus --> `--top 5` for the 5 most urgent, `--top 20` for more, `--top 0` to hide the list and just see the table
3. Drill into what the list points at --> e.g. a `host_down` row → `inventory hosts`; an `alarm` row → `get_alarms`; a `capacity` row → `perf hosts` / `capacity datastores`; scope with `--cluster prod-a`
4. Reshape the view on request --> the output ends with a friendly hint; the operator can say "add datastore free space", "drop the DRS column", "only show clusters needing attention", or "save this as an HTML page". Default layout, columns, and thresholds live in [`references/health-summary-template.md`](references/health-summary-template.md) and are meant to be edited
5. Save an offline snapshot --> `vmware-monitor summary --html` writes a self-contained HTML file (no external assets, nothing uploaded) to `~/vmware-health/cluster-health-<vc>-<timestamp>.html`; `--html-path <file>` for an explicit path. The timestamped filename means a folder of them becomes a browsable point-in-time history. It is a snapshot, not a live page — re-run to refresh
6. **On a very large fleet** --> add `--no-vms` to skip the VM rollup pass when you only need host/alarm/capacity signals
7. **If it returns zero clusters** --> the target may be a standalone ESXi host (no clusters); use `inventory hosts` + `health alarms` instead

### Daily Health Check

**Judgment**: alarms tell you what vCenter has decided is wrong, events tell you what happened. They diverge — an event burst with no alarms often signals a metric threshold miscalibration, not "everything is fine." Read both.

1. Check alarms --> `vmware-monitor health alarms --target prod-vcenter` — focus on Red severity AND alarms older than 1 hour (transient ones self-clear)
2. Review recent events --> `vmware-monitor health events --hours 24 --severity warning` — look for repeated events from the same entity (a single event is noise; 50 events in an hour is a pattern)
3. List hosts --> `vmware-monitor inventory hosts` — flag hosts disconnected, in maintenance mode unexpectedly, or memory > 90%
4. **If connection fails** --> run `vmware-monitor doctor` to diagnose config/network issues

### Object-Centered Investigation ("what is happening around this VM / host / datastore?")

**Judgment**: this is the drill-down the operator wants after triage points at a problem — one call *correlates* the object with its surrounding infrastructure and recent history, so you explain the aggregated result in operational language instead of stitching five tools yourself. The tool aggregates; you never dump raw inventory into the conversation.

Offer the levels progressively — do **not** ask for details the environment already fixes:
1. **Start at the top** --> `cross_vcenter_attention` (CLI: `vmware-monitor attention`) for "what needs attention now?" across every vCenter. If only one vCenter is configured, skip straight to its `cluster_health_summary` — no need to ask which target
2. **Offer to drill into an object** the top-issues list points at. Ask *which level* only when it is genuinely ambiguous:
   - a VM --> `vm_investigation_bundle` (CLI: `vmware-monitor investigate vm <name>`) → VM state, recent events, snapshots, alarms & recent changes, the host it runs on, the cluster context, the datastores backing it, performance signals, and a correlated event timeline
   - a host --> `host_investigation_bundle` (CLI: `investigate host <name>`) → host state, cluster context, the VMs it runs, mounted datastores, alarms, performance, correlated timeline
   - a datastore --> `datastore_investigation_bundle` (CLI: `investigate datastore <name>`) → capacity/free, mounting hosts, VMs it backs, alarms, correlated timeline
3. **Widen or narrow** on request --> `--hours 72` for a longer event window; the bundle ends with a hint listing what is adjustable
4. **Make it tangible** --> add `--html` to any `investigate`/`attention` command for a self-contained offline snapshot (drill-down sections collapse/expand natively, no JS, nothing uploaded) written to `~/vmware-health/`
5. **If the object name is unknown** --> the tool returns a *teaching* error naming exactly how to list the objects (`list_virtual_machines` / `list_esxi_hosts` / `list_all_datastores`); get the exact name and retry
6. **If a vCenter is unreachable** (attention only) --> it is listed under `unreachable` with a reason and the rest still aggregate — surface the gap, don't fail the whole view

### Performance Triage ("the cluster feels slow")
**Judgment**: inventory shows *configured* capacity (cores, GB); it cannot tell you what is actually hot. Use the real-time perf tools, then narrow.
1. Rank hosts --> `vmware-monitor perf hosts` — the busiest host floats to the top (sorted by CPU%)
2. Rank VMs on the suspect --> `vmware-monitor perf vms --limit 25` — find the noisy neighbour
3. Check for hidden storage pressure --> `vmware-monitor capacity datastores` — over-commit % > 100 means a thin datastore can fill mid-run even with "free" space showing
4. Rule out snapshot drag --> `vmware-monitor snapshots aging --only-old` — old snapshots silently degrade I/O
5. **If perf tools return empty** --> the host/VM may be disconnected or powered off (no real-time provider); confirm with `inventory hosts` / `inventory vms`

### Scheduled-Outage Pre-flight (certs, licenses, time)
1. Cert expiry --> `vmware-monitor infra certs --warn-days 60` — an expired ESXi cert drops host management
2. License headroom --> `vmware-monitor infra licenses` — catch over-allocation before it disables features
3. Time sync --> `vmware-monitor infra ntp` — `healthy: no` breaks SSO/Kerberos/log correlation (note: live offset is not exposed by the SOAP API, only config health)

### Set Up Continuous Monitoring
1. Configure webhook in `~/.vmware-monitor/config.yaml`
2. Start daemon --> `vmware-monitor daemon start`
3. Daemon scans every 15 min, sends alerts to Slack/Discord

## Usage Mode

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|----------|:-----------:|-----|
| Local/small models (Ollama, Qwen) | **CLI** | ~2K tokens vs ~8K for MCP |
| Cloud models (Claude, GPT-4o) | Either | MCP gives structured JSON I/O |
| Automated pipelines | **MCP** | Type-safe parameters, structured output |

## MCP Tools (27 — all read-only)

| Tool | Description |
|------|------------|

| `host_log_scan` | Scan recent ESXi host syslog (hostd/vmkernel/vpxa) for error/warning patterns; returns only matching lines, optionally filtered to one host |

All tools are **read-only**. No tool can modify, create, or delete any resource.
Performance/capacity readings are point-in-time samples — this skill retains no
history, so it never reports a fabricated "trend" or runway date.

### List result shape

The 19 row-listing tools above return the family list envelope
`{items, returned, limit, total, truncated, hint}`, not a bare array. Read
`truncated` before summarising: `true` means more rows exist — never call
`items` the whole picture; `false` states the result is complete — including
when `items` is empty, which means "checked, found none", not "the call
failed". A `null` `total` (`get_events`, `host_log_scan`) is deliberate.
Aggregate tools return purpose-built objects instead — field table and
example payload: `references/capabilities.md`.

## Read-Only Mode

All 27 tools here are reads, so read-only mode withholds nothing — but
`VMWARE_READ_ONLY=true` (or `VMWARE_MONITOR_READ_ONLY`, or `read_only: true` in
config.yaml) still applies, and the gate verifies at start-up that zero write
tools are exposed rather than taking this document's word for it. The same
variable withholds write tools across every companion skill, so a whole-estate
audit posture is one setting. `vmware-monitor doctor` reports the current state
and its source. Running with local or small models? See [`references/agent-guardrails.md`](references/agent-guardrails.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Alarms returns empty but vCenter shows alarms
The `get_alarms` tool queries triggered alarms at the root folder level. Some alarms are entity-specific — try checking events instead: `get_events --hours 1 --severity info`.

### "Connection refused" error
1. Run `vmware-monitor doctor` to diagnose
2. Verify target hostname/IP and port (443) in config.yaml
3. For self-signed certs: set `disableSslCertValidation: true`

### Events returns too many results
Use severity filter: `--severity warning` (default) filters out info-level events. Use `--hours 4` to narrow time range.

### VM info shows "guest_os: unknown"
VMware Tools not installed or not running in the guest. Install/start VMware Tools for guest OS detection, IP address, and guest family info.

### Doctor passes but commands fail with timeout
vCenter may be under heavy load. Try targeting a specific ESXi host directly instead of vCenter, or increase connection timeout in config.yaml.

### Should I set `environment:` on a read-only skill?
Yes — add `environment: production` (or `staging`, `lab`, your own label) to
each target in `~/.vmware-monitor/config.yaml`. Policy scopes its rules by
declared environment, not target name; this skill has zero write tools, so
**no monitor command is ever refused or delayed by this** — reads are never
gated. It matters for the write skills (`vmware-aiops`, `vmware-storage`,
`vmware-nsx`) pointed at the same vCenter: an undeclared target warns on every
write today and is refused in the next major release. A consistent label
across the family's config files makes that upgrade a no-op. Config example:
`references/setup-guide.md`.

## Setup

```bash
uv tool install vmware-monitor
vmware-monitor init      # guided: prompts for host/user/password, writes config + .env (chmod 600), then verifies
```

`init` stores the password grep-safe (obfuscated `b64:`, never plaintext) and
locks `.env` to 0600. Prefer it over hand-editing; manual steps:
`references/setup-guide.md`.

## Audit & Safety

All operations are automatically audited via vmware-policy (`@vmware_tool` decorator):
- Every tool call logged to `~/.vmware/audit.db` (SQLite, framework-agnostic)
- Policy rules enforced via `~/.vmware/rules.yaml` (deny rules, maintenance windows, risk levels)
- Risk classification: each tool tagged as low/medium/high/critical
- View recent operations: `vmware-audit log --last 20`
- View denied operations: `vmware-audit log --status denied`

vmware-policy is automatically installed as a dependency — no manual setup needed.
